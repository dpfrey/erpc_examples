# eRPC Examples

A collection of examples demonstrating key concepts of [eRPC](https://github.com/EmbeddedRPC/erpc)


## Examples

### counter
A simple counter API and a test client/server written using the C++ classes of eRPC

### counter_c
The same as counter, except written in C instead of C++

## Status
Some difficulties were found while trying to create examples. Github issues
[#113](https://github.com/EmbeddedRPC/erpc/issues/113) and
[#114](https://github.com/EmbeddedRPC/erpc/issues/114) were created to track these issues. The
`erpc_1.7.4.patch` file in this repository contains workarounds for these issues.
